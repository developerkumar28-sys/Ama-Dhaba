🍽️ Local Food Connect

A unified platform that connects local restaurants, dhabas, and food vendors in one place for seamless food ordering.

📌 About The Project

Local Food Connect is a mobile application prototype designed to digitize small and local food businesses. The app allows users to discover nearby restaurants, browse menus, check prices and ratings, and place orders quickly with a single click.

This project focuses on empowering local vendors by providing them with an affordable digital presence while offering customers a smooth and convenient food ordering experience.
